This repository contains a simple example demonstrating how to use nested if statements and how they can be simplified using elif in Python.

🔍 What You'll Learn
The difference between if, elif, and else statements

How to write cleaner and more readable conditional logic

Why elif is useful compared to nested if statements
📘 Explanation
if: Tests a condition; if it's true, the code block runs.

elif (short for else if): Tests another condition if the previous if was false.

else: Runs if all preceding if and elif conditions are false.

📝 Notes
You can have multiple elif statements.

You can have only one else statement.

The else block is optional.

Using elif helps to avoid deeply nested code and makes your logic more readable.
